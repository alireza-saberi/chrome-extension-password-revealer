## Get Started
This Chrome extension was developed on hacking style during this weekend for personal purposes and fun after reading Google Chrome extension documents.
The type of this extension is browser action which means its icon sits beside the omnibox

To control DOM manipulation `content_script` matches with `<all_ulrs>` and `run_at` the `document_end`
